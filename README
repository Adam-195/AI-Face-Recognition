V1.0 is now live
    - The model is now fully operational, and can recognise every individual with an image in the 'faces' direcotry


Quality of Life Improvements Req:
    - FPS Tanks when indetifing indivuals
    - Make a more seemless way to close the application
    - Improve Graphics of Elements


Future Goals:
    - Write an algo that sorts and groups images indiviuals and indetifies them via webcam
    - Use my learnings of each module to create a 'FACE ID' like autheticator for projects like the Warzone Tracker
